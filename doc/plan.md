# Compynation development plan
---
### Topic
The task is to write a python clone of the C64 game **Combination**.  
This document is an attempt to outline my rough plan for how I will approach this task.  

### Steps
- [x] Run and play the existing combination game
- [x] Document the behavior of the existing game
    * done at: [combination.md](combination.md)
- [x] Decide and note which parts of the original game are a core part of this project,  
which ones are optional extensions and which one will be dropped for the remake
- [x] Create an architecture draft
- [x] Separate the task into building blocks
- [x] Prioritize the building blocks
- [x] Repeat for each block, in order:
    * Code it
    * Write tests
    * Update documentation
- [x] Wrap everything together
- [x] Test that the entire thing runs in the reference VM as expected
- [ ] Submit the result

### Questions

* Is PyGame feasible as frontend?
* Can I automatically setup / install dependencies?
* How to honor / reference the original creators?
* Can I get nice images for the UI somewhere?
* Can I get background music somewhere?
